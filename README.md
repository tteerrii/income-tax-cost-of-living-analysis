# Income, Tax & Cost of Living Analysis (US)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes how much income remains after tax, rent, and grocery costs across different U.S. states.  
The goal is to evaluate whether higher nominal income actually translates into better living affordability.

## 📊 Data Sources
- State-level income data  
- State tax brackets and personal exemptions  
- Average rent data  
- Grocery cost data  

(All data were cleaned and standardized before analysis.)

## 🧮 Key Metric
Remaining Income is calculated as:

Remaining Income = After-Tax Income − Annual Rent − Annual Grocery Cost

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills
- SQL (data cleaning & joins)
- R (data transformation & calculation)
- Tableau (visualization)
- Excel (initial inspection)

## 📈 Visualization
The final output is a Tableau map visualizing remaining income across U.S. states, with missing values clearly labeled.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- High-income states do not always result in high remaining income  
- Cost of living significantly offsets nominal wage advantages  
- Several mid-income states outperform major economic hubs in affordability

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Grocery cost is estimated using average weekly expenditure  
- Analysis assumes a fixed household structure  
- Local city-level variation is not fully captured

## 📎 Next Steps
- Add city-level income and rent data  
- Compare single vs two-person households  
- Extend analysis to include healthcare and transportation costs
